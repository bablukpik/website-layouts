# Flexbox Layouts

Website templates using css flexbox.

## Description

* The `layout1.html` template renders `header, body, and footer` elements. In here we haven't used `body` element for making flexible layout that's why we had to subtract `header` and `footer` width manually.

* The `layout2.html` template renders `header, body, and footer` elements. But we include the `body` element as a flexible layout. I'd recommend using this layout as this is much simpler.
